# Resolve RustSec vulnerabilities in Cargo.lock with `cargo audit fix`.
#
# `cargo audit fix` only runs `cargo update <pkgid>` for each vulnerable crate,
# so it touches Cargo.lock alone and stays within the semver ranges the
# manifests already allow; a fix that needs a breaking bump is reported as
# remaining instead. The updated Cargo.lock is left in the working tree.
#
# Args: $1  file to write a markdown summary to (used as the PR body)
# Exit: 0 no vulnerabilities remain; 3 some remain (need manual action);
#       anything else is an error.
