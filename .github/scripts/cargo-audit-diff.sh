# PR-level `cargo audit` that only fails on advisories the PR introduces.
#
# Advisories that also affect the base branch's Cargo.lock (typically one
# published after the base was last audited) are reported as warnings: they
# are not the PR's doing, and fixing them on the PR would invalidate its
# approvals. The Cargo Audit Fix workflow resolves them on the base branch.
#
# Findings are compared as (advisory id, crate name) pairs, so bumping an
# already-vulnerable crate to another vulnerable version does not count as new.
#
# Args: $1  path to the base branch's Cargo.lock
# Run from the repo root, so .cargo/audit.toml applies to both lockfiles.
